# Identify and describe the ruby method you implemented. 
# For both methods, I used the built in each method to help modify the integers in the array and hash. 
#However, we had to use an If statement for the my_array_modification_method because in the array held
#both integers and strings as elements. We had to differentiate the two so that we could modify only 
#the integers. The hash modification method we created was bit easier in the fact that the hash all had 
#a integer for it's value. This allowed us to change and modify each age of each pet.

# Reflect!
# My strategy for my portion of this challenge was to use a similar strategy to the first couple of excercises
# I worked on in this weeks challenges. I have become familiar with the each method, so I figured that the 
# each method would suffice what I needed to do for my part. A problem I faced was when I was trying to modify
# the values of the keys in the hash. I knew how to modify the elements of an array, but using the each method
# on a hash was a bit of a curveball. However, after spending some time in office hours, I taught
